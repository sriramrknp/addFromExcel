# Add From Excel

I developed a Node.js application to add candidate records from Excel to a MongoDB database. 

The application was implemented using Express on the back-end and used async.eachSeries to ensure that the application could handle heavy data efficiently and quickly. 

This was implemented using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
